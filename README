Classes present in this repository are dummies, and should fully implement
the expected API that'll be used in Settings. 

Each device should implement its own classes for supported hardware 
tunables, and signal their existence by adding a BOARD_HARDWARE_CLASS 
variable to its BoardConfig, pointing to the path where said classes
can be found. The Nexus4, for instance, has

BOARD_HARDWARE_CLASS := device/lge/mako/cmhw/

Every class present in this framework addresses a hardware tunable;
Devices don't need to implement all the classes, but for every one
that _is_ implemented, all methods existing in this dummy implementation
must be present.
